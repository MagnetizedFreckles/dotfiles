# Just my dotfiles

Made by a noob user.
Used lots of sample configs and other people's dotfiles.

You shouldn't try to use this, seriously.

*Managed using git bare repo*

## Fonts

**FiraCode** as a main font and **Iosevka** for italics in WezTerm.
All patched **Nerd Fonts**.

## Shell

I mostly use **fish**, but still have an **oh-my-zsh** config and **bashrc** with basic aliases.  
Also stole someone's config for **nushell**, but not planning on using it any time soon.

And yeah, **starship** as my prompt engine. Pretty comfy.

## Terminal

Right now I use **WezTerm**, previously used **Alacritty**.

However, instead of builtin tab functionality, I still use **tmux**.  
Probably going to change my multiplexer to **zellij** when there will be session saving feature added.

## Editor

**NeoVim** with **LazyVim** config. Did some changes though.

## Other stuff

**XCompose** file with some additional symbols for Compose Key.

**Markdownlint**, **prettier** and **stylua** config files.
Not actively using the first two however.
